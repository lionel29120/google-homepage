Google Homepage project for The Odin Project

At the beginning, trying to do a simple page which looks like the google's one

Trying to improve it afterwards

1st step: html skeleton, basic css
1st step done.

2nd step: visual effects and search functions
2nd step done

3rd step: display google apps window and settings windows
This is managed without any javascript as didn't get through the javascript module at the moment.
Solution involve checkbox with labels: when checkbox is checked a div appears with the menu
the div menu is contained in a larger div which allow to uncheck the checkbox when clicked and make the menu disappear otherwise the menu disappears only when the settings link is clicked.
